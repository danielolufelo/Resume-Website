				<p><span style="font-size:21px"><br/><b>Auto Summary</b><span><br>
				Researchers and students constantly face 
				this scenario: It is almost impossible to 
				read most if not all of the newly published 
				papers to be informed of the latest progress
				and when they work on a research project, the 
				time spent on reading literature review seems 
				endless. The goal of this project is to design a 
				domain independent, automatic text extraction system 
				to alleviate, if not totally solve, this problem. </p>

				<p><span style="font-size:21px"><br/><b>Friend Mapper </b><span><br>
				In current system, in order to find out 
				the location of friends, user need to call
				and ask friend about his whereabouts. The
				proposed system will help user to find out 
				friends’ locations as well as the distance
				from user’s location. The proposed system 
				will also allow user to see all friends on 
				Google map as well. </p>

				<p><span style="font-size:21px"><br/><b>Meeting Scheduler</b><span><br>
				This project is aimed at developing a 
				scheduler for group meetings. This is a
				web-based tool. Any user can call for a
				meeting and send the detailed co-ordinates 
				of the meeting (location, date, time etc.) 
				to all invitees. This is useful for a small 
				office, school or a department or for that 
				matter any group who is interested to organize
				it effectively. Facility to book room and
				editing booked room are also available. </p></br>
